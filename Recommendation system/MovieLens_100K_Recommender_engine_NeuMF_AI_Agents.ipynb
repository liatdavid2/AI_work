    "## The Project: AI Agents for Diverse Movie Recommendations using LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds an AI agent system using the **LangGraph** framework to provide personalized movie recommendations based on the **MovieLens 100K** dataset. The system uses a pre-trained **NeuMF** model ([He et al., 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3038912.3052569)) for collaborative filtering and is enhanced with multiple agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RecommenderAgent**: Predicts top-20 movies for each user based on the trained NeuMF model.\n",
    "2. **DiversityRerankerAgent**: Selects the most diverse top-5 subset from the recommendations by balancing rating quality and genre variety.\n",
    "3. **CritiqueAgent**: Uses a language model (e.g., Granite) to evaluate the recommendation list and provide critique about thematic richness, emotional depth, and genre coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent operates within a **LangGraph pipeline**, enabling structured reasoning and modular evaluation. The full system prints user history, generates diverse recommendations, and explains potential weaknesses in the results.\n"
