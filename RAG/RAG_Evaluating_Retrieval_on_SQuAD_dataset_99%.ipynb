    "# The Project:The Project: Evaluating Retrieval on SQuAD with Sentence Transformers and FAISS 99.2%\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a simplified **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** setup using a subset of the **SQuAD** dataset. Instead of generating answers, it focuses on the **retrieval** component—evaluating whether a retriever can return contexts that contain the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence embedding model (`multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1`) encodes both questions and their corresponding \"Q: ... C: ...\" pairs. The embeddings are normalized, and a **FAISS index** is used for efficient top-5 similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is performed by checking if the **gold answer** appears as a **substring** in any of the top-5 retrieved results. This serves as a proxy for answerability within the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Dataset: 500 SQuAD validation samples\n",
    "- Task: Question → Retrieve top-5 relevant \"Q + C\" pairs\n",
    "- Metric: Substring-based Top-5 Accuracy\n",
    "- Result: Shows how well semantic retrievers can support downstream QA in a RAG pipeline\n"

    "# The Dataset: SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)** is a benchmark dataset for evaluating machine reading comprehension and question-answering systems. It was developed by researchers at Stanford University and has become a widely-used standard in the field of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type**: Extractive Question Answering\n",
    "- **Language**: English\n",
    "- **Domain**: Wikipedia articles\n",
    "- **Task**: Given a question and a context paragraph, the goal is to find the answer span within the paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample in SQuAD consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `context`: A paragraph extracted from a Wikipedia article.\n",
    "- `question`: A question related to the paragraph.\n",
    "- `answers`: A list of one or more acceptable answers, each provided as:\n",
    "  - `text`: The actual answer string.\n",
    "  - `answer_start`: The character index where the answer begins in the context.\n",
